# Adventure

Welcome to the current version of "Adventureee"

The current purpose of this project is to show how we can handle creating multiple tables, adding/removing/updating information within them
using querys that can work with any setting within the scope. 

Known things:
Haven't fully implemented "health" and "gold" properties. They will come in a future version.

Adding a second story, also coming soon.
